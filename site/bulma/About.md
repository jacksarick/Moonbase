# [Bulma](http://bulma.io)

Once upon a time, this was Bulma. But I (jacksarick) decided that it was too much, so I took a matchete to jgthms's beautiful work, and cut out all the "unecessary" parts. What lies before you is my hacked (get it?) version of it.

##Specifics
Things that got the boot:

- All of layouts
- Components:
	- card.sass
	- highlight.sass
	- level.sass
	- media.sass
	- menu.sass
	- message.sass
	- nav.sass
	- pagination.sass
	- tabs.sass
- Elements:
	- box.sass
	- content.sass
	- image.sass
	- progress.sass
	- table.sass
