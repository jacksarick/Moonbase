# Moonbase
Honestly, I'm not quite sure yet. It has something to do about managing the UCC Student Server Space, but that's a little hazy. Mostly, I'm learning fullstack development, and picking up a new language. This isn't the best example of my code, but it's something.

## TODO

- [ ] Make the thing actually do stuff
- [ ] SSL
- [ ] Login that doesn't suck
- [ ] Some whisper of documentation when this all enevitabley fails

## Use
run `./key-gen.sh` to set the password (or not. see if I care. default is "password").

run `./start.rb` to start the server.

edit `config.yml` as you see fit. but in reality you don't need to. it's just a formality.

## Help

basically I'm a crazy old hermit working on a project. if you want to help, don't get it the way. I reserve the right to allow/deny pull requests as I see fit with no explanation whatsoever. things change often and break even moreso, so good luck. if you're considering making the html look better, power to ya. it's a sysiphysian task at the moment.
