Honestly, I'm not quite sure yet. It has something to do about managing the UCC Student Server Space, but that's a little hazy. Mostly, I'm learning fullstack development, and picking up a new language.

## Use
run `./key-gen.sh` to set the password (or not. see if I care default is "p". yeah, just a lowercase p).

run `./start.rb` to start the server.

edit `config.yml` as you see fit. but in reality you don't need to. it's just a formality.
